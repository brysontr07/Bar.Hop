# Bar.Hop
This project is to develop an app that allows the customer to order alcoholic drinks at their local venue from their own phone. It will allow workers(bartenders) to collect tips directly and sign up to work at various locations.  It will allow venue owners to manage stock,  manage employees, post promotions(i.e. happy hour) and view statistics.
